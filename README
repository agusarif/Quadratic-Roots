Quadratic-Roots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A programming project to built a Javascript that could compute the two roots
of a quadratic equation. The standard form of a quadratic equation which is used here:
				A x^2 + B x + C = 0

The script will ask a user to supply the values of the three coefficients A,
B, and C. And then, it will display the appropriate roots of the quadratic equation. Lastly, the script offers a chance for the user to validate the
computed solutions.
